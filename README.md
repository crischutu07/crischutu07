# Where did I started here?
I explore this website since 2020 when I was 13 years old. I was enough to code stuff in here, I started my first project is making [PocketMine-MP](github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP) Plugins. I making a lot when I having my PC. In that road, my PC is on oopies but I moved into a Linux Terminal on Android is [Termux](github.com/termux/termux-app)
This app making me better to code in a Terminal, also I was code my Project into that. Then I moved to making Bash script when I was 14 years old.
